# FNGU Tracker

This project aims to solve a common problem for investors with stake in an Exchange Trade Fund (ETF).

## The Problem

An ETF is is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other asset and they are influenced by the performance of the basket of securities it tracks.
Investors of an ETF typically like to see the performance of the individual securities that are influencing their ETF investments and depending on the ETF, usually the only option available is opening additional tabs to display the individual charts.

## The Solution

This app compiles current daily data from the basket of securities of a given ETF (currently working solely for FNGU) and displays the charts on a single page. It also renders the "top mover" to the top of the page.
